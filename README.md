## 🧩 **Modules & Components**

### 🎮 Game Engine

Each game is modular, powered by a **probability-based Random Number Generator (RNG)** to ensure fairness:

* **Blackjack** – Player vs dealer logic, betting system, Ace handling.
* **Roulette** – Supports inside/outside bets, animations for spins.
* **Slot Machine** – Reel combinations, payout tables, spin animations.
* **Dice Game** – High/low bets with probability-based outcomes.
* **Lucky Wheel** – Bonus spins for user engagement.
* *(Optional Advanced)* **Texas Hold’em Poker** with WebSocket-based multiplayer.

### 👤 User Management

* **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt-hashed passwords, optional Google OAuth.
* **Profile**: Avatar, wallet, statistics, XP-based leveling.
* **Gamification**: XP rewards, streak bonuses, ranking system.

---

### 💸 Virtual Economy

* **Wallet**: Users start with 1000 virtual coins.
* **Earning**: Wins, achievements, daily bonuses, referrals.
* **Spending**: Betting in games, wheel spins.
